# OPERATING SYSTEM AND NETWORK PROGRAMMING
## _A guide to operating system and networking concepts_

Operating System and Network Programming delves into the fundamental and practical aspects of operating systems, including process scheduling, inter-process communication, and semaphores, as well as network programming in Java, focusing on TCP/IP, UDP, and socket-based communication.

## Pre - requisite
Concepts of Operating Systems and Networking, and Programming knowledge in C and JAVA

## Contents
The repository contains the following:

### OPERATING SYSTEM
